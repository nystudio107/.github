### Reporting vulnerabilities

Please email reports about any security related issues you find to
`info@nystudio107.com`. Your email will be acknowledged within one business day, and you'll receive a more detailed response to your email within 7 days indicating the next steps in handling your report. 

Please use a descriptive subject line for your report email. After the initial reply to your report, we will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and announcement.

In addition, please include the following information along with your report:

* Your name and affiliation (if any).
* A description of the technical details of the vulnerabilities. It is very
  important to let us know how we can reproduce your findings.
* An explanation who can exploit this vulnerability, and what they gain when
  doing so -- write an attack scenario. This will help us evaluate your report
  quickly, especially if the issue is complex.
* Whether this vulnerability public or known to third parties. If it is, please
  provide details.

If you believe that an existing (public) issue is security-related, please send
an email to `info@nystudio107.com`. The email should include the issue ID and
a short description of why it should be handled according to this security
policy.

Once an issue is reported, nystudio107 uses the following disclosure process:

* When a report is received, we confirm the issue and determine its severity.
* Wherever possible, fixes are prepared for the last minor release of the two
  latest major releases, as well as the master branch. We will attempt to
  commit these fixes as soon as possible, and as close together as
  possible.

We credit reporters for identifying security issues, although we keep your name confidential if you request it.
